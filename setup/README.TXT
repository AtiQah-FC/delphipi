Description:

Delphi Package Installer (DelphiPI) is a tool which aids you installing components to your Delphi IDE. 
DelphiPI automatically resolves dependencies between packages, compiles, installs and adds source paths to your IDE.

Not properly tested.


How To Use:
    * Start DelphiPI
    * Select the folder where both package file (*.dpk) and source files (*.pas) reside. 

    If the directory structure is like: 

    SuperLibrary?\packages SuperLibrary?\source 

    then just select SuperLibrary? folder. 

    * Specify a pattern that matches for your delphi installation. If you don't want to use a pattern just leave it as *.dpk and unselect the packages that are not suitable for your delphi installation.
    * Click Compile. Packages will be compiled and installed.
